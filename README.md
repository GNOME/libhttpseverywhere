libhttpseverywhere
==================

In the near future this library will enable you to leverage the power of 
[HTTPSEverywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) to any desktop-application you want

HTTPSEverywhere is a browser plugin that comes with a set of rules that you can use to ensure that
you use HTTP instead of HTTPS only when this is absolutely not circumventable.
With libhttpseverywhere you will get a C-library you can link/bind against in almost all languages

libhttpseverywhere is being written to be used in [Rainbow Lollipop](http://rainbow-lollipop.de)

As a library written in Vala, libhttpseverywhere will support GObject-Introspection. This means
that you can use the lib in many popular languages like e.g. Ruby, Python or Javascript.
